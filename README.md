# jetc

JETC is a C++ library that provides a simple and efficient way to serialize and deserialize complex C++ data structures to a binary format.

* JETC supports a variety of C++ data types including custom data structures, floats, chars, doubles, ints, shorts, longs, long longs, and bools. It also supports the serialization of STL containers such as std::list, std::map, std::vector, and std::array.

* JETC allows you to easily convert your C++ objects into a binary format that can be easily transmitted over a network or saved to disk. It uses a binary format that is both compact and efficient, making it a good choice for applications where bandwidth or storage space is limited.

* To use JETC, you simply include the appropriate headers and call the appropriate functions to serialize or deserialize your data structures. JETC also includes support for custom serialization functions, allowing you to easily add support for additional data types or to customize the serialization of existing types.

* Overall, JETC is a powerful and flexible library for serializing complex C++ data structures to a compact binary format. Its support for a wide range of data types and containers, combined with its efficient binary format, make it a good choice for many applications.
